As of January 23rd, 2016, the development repository for Lucene and Solr has 
moved to a GIT (see issue LUCENE-6937).

The GIT repository contains full history of both projects
and can be found here:

git://git.apache.org/lucene-solr.git

The historical content of SVN repository is preserved. If you wish 
to see the last revision before the migration, use:

svn update -r 1726343
<<<END

2. The same for https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/lucene/dev/branches/branch_5x

3. Try to sync up the existing svn git checkout on gamma.

4. Start svn->git cloning on gamma.

5. Perform migration steps (gamma).

5.1 revert the migration commit on master and branch_5x

5.2 upload repo to github.

6. Sanity check of the github's clone.
   - compare branch_5x against -r 1726343 https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/lucene/dev/branches/branch_5x
   - compare master against    -r 1726343 https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/lucene/dev/trunk
   - compare lucene-solr/5.4.1 against -r 1726343 https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/lucene/dev/tags/lucene_solr_5_4_1

   !! Changes in whitespace only (local git on Windows, no native EOLs).
   !! Missing empty folders

7. Apply Mark's build patches to branch_5x and master.

   !! did not apply to branch_5x!

8. Notify Daniel:
   - which repos to permamently remove,
   - which repo to clean and import afresh (converted repo address),
   - make GitHub aware of the migration/ removed repos?

9. Notify the dev. list.
